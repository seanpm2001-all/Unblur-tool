# How to protect against this tool

Unfortunately, many images were made without considering that they could be unblurred. This project can unblur images up to 97.5 DPI but can't unblur images where a solid color bar is placed over the image.

## Why

I was afraid of releasing this tool due to how many images and videos it can unblur, but I knew it had to be created, as people need to know to protect against it and be more careful.

## Main solutions

* Put a fully (100%) opaque (solid color) bar/box over whatever you want to censor.

* Pixelate the portion you want to censor, so there are at least 16 giant pixels for every 256-1024 pixels.
